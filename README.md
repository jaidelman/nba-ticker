# NBA-Ticker
The purpose of this project is to display live NBA scores on an Adafruit 16x32 LED Matrix.

# Hardware
I used [Adafruit's 16x32 LED Matrix](https://www.adafruit.com/product/420), their [MatrixPortal](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4745) and a USB C power supply

# Software
The code is written in Python using Adafruit and CircuitPython's libraries to control the LED Board
